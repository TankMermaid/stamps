Amy's course materials for Strategies And Techniques For Analysing Microbial Population Structures (STAMPS) at the Marine Biological Laboratory, 2017

This folder mostly contains materials related to the R tutorial, but some other materials as well

## For Students

### Before STAMPS/Monday night

Ensure that you have R and RStudio installed on your computer, and that you know how to load a package from both CRAN and github. 

See [here](https://stamps.mbl.edu/index.php/Installing_R) for instructions on how to do this

### Tuesday morning

### Tuesday night

Continue working through up to the end of Option B. Do not worry about finishing Option C if you are relatively new to R! 


## For STAMPS TAs who don't know R
1. Please install R and RStudio onto your computer, and read through the [instructions on installing R](https://stamps.mbl.edu/index.php/Installing_R) so that you have enough familiarity to help students who encounter difficulties
2. Please attend the Monday night session to help with installation. 
3. If possible, please also attend the Tuesday morning session to help students where you can

## For STAMPS TAs who know some R

1. I'll assume that you already have R on your computer, but please also install RStudio
2. Please work through the [Option A tutorial](https://github.com/adw96/stamps/STAMPS_Intro2R_OptionA.R) 
..* No need to go through in excruciating detail or do the exercises, just enough to know what's happening so you can help students on the day
3. Have a quick read through the [Option B tutorial](https://github.com/adw96/stamps/STAMPS_Intro2R_OptionB.R) and [the solutions](https://github.com/adw96/stamps/STAMPS_Intro2R_OptionB_solutions.R)

If you think an important explanation is missing, feel free to fork the repository and submit your changes, or email me!

## For STAMPS TAs who use R regularly

1. Please work through [Option A tutorial](https://github.com/adw96/stamps/STAMPS_Intro2R_OptionA.R), [Option B tutorial](https://github.com/adw96/stamps/STAMPS_Intro2R_OptionB.R) and [Option B solutions](https://github.com/adw96/stamps/STAMPS_Intro2R_OptionB_solutions.R)
2. Please critically review the material and think about any missing explanations. Note that some code is deliberately erroneous to force the students to practice correcting their own errors.
3. If you would like to see something included or changed, please fork the repository and submit your changes
4. Optional but greatly appreciated: I'm trying to think about how to engage some of the more advanced students, so am filling out an [Option C tutorial](https://github.com/adw96/stamps/STAMPS_Intro2R_OptionC.R). Please help me by contributing an example or some new functionality along with a description of how to use it. Currently
..* cast, melt
..* plyr
..* ddply
..* parallelisation
..* Markdown
mini tutorials need to be filled out. Feel free to contribute to these or include your own!
